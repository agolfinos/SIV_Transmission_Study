# SIV_Transmission_Study
Set of scripts used to analyze intrarectal and intravenous barcode data from infection of macaques with SIVmac239M.

Important Considerations: 
With this set of scripts, you will be required to use Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is free to download, and we recommend downloading Anaconda Navigator
and using Anaconda to access Jupyter Notebook. Anaconda Navigator is available at: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

There are multiple scripts included in this repository, and each one is used for different reasons.
